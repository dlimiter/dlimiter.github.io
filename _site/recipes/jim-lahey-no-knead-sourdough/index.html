    <div class="recipe__ingredients">
      
        
          <p>425 grams bread flour</p>
        
          <p>1½ tsp salt</p>
        
          <p>180 grams fed sourdough starter (or ¼ tsp instant yeast for the original recipe)</p>
        
          <p>300g water</p>
        
      
    </div>

  <section class="recipe__section recipe__method">
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. In a small mixing bowl, stir together 300 grams of lukewarm tap water with the sourdough starter, then pour the mixture into the bowl with the flour mixture. Mix until just combined.</p>

<p>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave it to rise overnight, about 18 hours. About six hours in give the dough a four way fold in the bowl with a pastry scraper for a more structured/firmer dough at the shaping stage.</p>

<p>After about 18 hours, dust a clean kitchen surface with flour. Scoop out the dough and place it on the surface, then dust with more flour. Gently fold the edges of the dough from the outside in, to form a round loaf. Dust a clean towel with yet more flour and place the dough on it, the seam side down, then cover and allow to double in size, about 2 hours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, heat oven to between 450 and 550 degrees. Place a covered enamel Dutch oven or heavy pot with a lid into the oven and allow it to heat for 30 minutes or so. Remove the pot from the oven, take off its top, and carefully invert the risen dough into it, so that the seam side is now facing up. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds, then put the top back on the pot and return it to the oven.</p>

<p>Bake for about 25 to 30 minutes, then take the top off the pot and allow it to continue to cook until it is brown and crusty all over, an additional 20 minutes or so. Put the loaf on a rack to cool for at least an hour  before serving.</p>
