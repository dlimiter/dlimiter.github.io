This is an unlisted project. It's still accessible via its direct URL at `/projects/example-unlisted/`, but it won't appear in the projects list on `/projects/` because `published: false`.

## Use cases for unlisted projects

- Work-in-progress experiments
- Projects you want to share privately via direct link
- Drafts and explorations
- Internal tools or utilities

You can share the URL directly with people without it being listed publicly.
