    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p class="lede">
      My name is Dave Lim. I'm a he/him multidisciplinary product design leader living in Melbourne, Australia.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe building great products is a team sport, and I'm passionate about close 
      cross-functional collaboration. My background as a software engineer gives me a technical 
      fluency that shapes my practice – I think in systems and models, and collaborate closely 
      across disciplines to find solutions that are desirable, viable, and feasible.
