title: Focaccia
description: Great for feeding large groups and really easy. Don’t baulk at the amount of cream that is added. Think of it as a butter replacement, only more delicious. Olive oil is not required for dipping either. The recipe can be easily adapted. Add some cheese to the top, or try a selection of different herbs. Just don’t add sun-dried tomatoes.

In a large mixing bowl, mix the flour, salt and olive oil. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the cold water and foamy yeast. Knead the dough by hand for five minutes or, alternatively, transfer into a mixer with a dough hook. After kneading, place the dough into a large bowl. Rub the dough with a little oil and cover with a damp cloth to prove to room temperature for about one hour.

After one hour or when the dough has doubled in size, transfer it to a lightly floured bench and knead once again to knock any air from the dough. Roll or with your hands push the dough out to about one-centimetre thick and transfer to a lightly oiled baking sheet. Leave the focaccia in a warm place to prove.

When it has doubled in size, make little divots with your fingertips pushing down into the dough. Gently drizzle the cream over the dough so that it fills the divots and creates a thick coating. Finally season with a good pinch of sea salt flakes and sprinkle the rosemary needles.

Leave for 10 minutes before baking in a preheated oven at 200ºC for 12 minutes.
