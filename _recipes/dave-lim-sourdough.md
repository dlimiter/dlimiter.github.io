#### Day 1
Combine ingredients in a bowl and mix into a coherent (probably lumpy) dough. Cover bowl with a tea towel and leave for 30 minutes.

##### First fold
Spritz bench top with water. Turn out dough and stretch-fold around 12 times. Return to bowl, cover leave for 2 hours.

##### Second fold
Spritz bench top with water. Turn out dough and stretch-fold around 6 times. Return to bowl, cover leave for 2 hours.

##### Final fold
Spritz bench top with water. Turn out dough and stretch-fold around 6 times. Return to bowl, cover leave for 1 hour.

##### Pre-shape and bench rest
Lightly flour bench so dough doesn't stick. Turn out dough (if making a bigger batch, this is when you separate into loaves by weight) and fold into a loose boule shape. Cover and bench rest for a final hour.

##### Shape
Delicately flatten dough out the pre-shaped loaves a bit and do final shaping. Transfer to proving basket and leave in fridge overnight.

#### Day 2
Prepare oven with baking steel and a metal baking tray on the bottom. Preheat for about an hour at maximum temperature.
Remove dough from fridge, turn out onto peel, score and transfer to oven. Pour a few cm of boiling water into baking tray and leave to bake for about 25 minutes.

Check loaf, rotate if necessary and bake for a further 10—20 minutes until well browned.
