serves:
ingredients:
- 260g all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 170g unsalted butter, melted
- 190g packed brown sugar
- 100 grams granulated sugar

- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 340g semisweet chocolate chips

Preheat the oven to 165°C. Prepare cookie sheets with baking paper.

Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt and set aside.

In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended.

Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just blended.

Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Roll dough into 20g balls and lay out on the prepared cookie sheets, about 2 inches apart.

Bake for 8—10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are lightly toasted.

Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
