serves:
ingredients:
- 2 cups (260g) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup (190g) packed brown sugar
- 1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) vanilla extract (yes, this is correct, but feel free to use less if it seems too much)
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 2 cups (340g) semisweet chocolate chips

Preheat the oven to 165Â°C. Prepare cookie sheets with baking paper.

Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt and set aside.

In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended.

Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just blended.

Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop cookie dough 1/4 cup at a time (for giant cookies) or a tablespoon at a time (for smaller cookies) onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 3 inches apart.

Bake larger cookies for 15 to 17 minutes, or 10 to 12 minutes for smaller ones in the preheated oven, or until the edges are lightly toasted.

Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
