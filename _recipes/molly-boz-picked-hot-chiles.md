The pickles themselves are crunchy, tangy, sweet, and addictive—but don't forget about the vinegary brine they're sitting in: The chiles infuse the vinegar, which creates a balanced, spicy, and acidic liquid that can be the base of your next vinaigrette.

Bring vinegar, sugar, salt, and garlic to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar and salt. Pour brine into a small heatproof jar or bowl, add chiles, and let cool.

Chiles can be pickled 1 month ahead. Cover and chill.
