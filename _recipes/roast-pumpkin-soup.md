Preheat oven to 200°C. Place the pumpkin, carrot, onion, cut-side up, and the garlic on a lightly greased large oven tray lined with non-stick baking paper. Drizzle with the oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Cook for 1 hour or until onion is caramelised and the carrot and pumpkin are soft. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Scoop the flesh of the pumpkin into a large saucepan. Remove the onion and garlic from their skins and add to the pan with the carrot.

Add the stock, and using a hand-held stick blender, blend the soup until smooth. Add water to taste.
