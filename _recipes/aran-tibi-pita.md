Mix bread flour and salt together in a bowl. In a separate bowl mix the water, olive oil, and yeast.

Mix the wet ingredients into the dry to form a rough dough. Knead for four minutes slowly and once everything is mixed knead this for another four minutes but faster than the first time.

Place dough into a clean bowl and prove for 45 minutes, or until double in size.

When the dough is ready, preheat oven to maximum heat (about 250 degrees) with a pizza stone on the middle shelf. Bash the dough back down and form balls of about 100g for a nice one per person portion. Flatten it down with a rolling pin, turning constantly until a perfect circle forms with about 5-6mm thickness. Cover with a damp cloth quickly as they tend to dry very fast. Let it rest for about 20 minutes.

One by one, transfer the pittas to the oven with a floured peel, giving them a spritz of water with a mister.  After about three minutes the pitta should be puffed up. Flip it and cook for a further two minutes.

Leave to cool covered with a dry cloth over a cooling rack and pack in a plastic bag to store.
