serves: Makes a bowl of beans
ingredients:
- 500g green beans (any variety)
- ½ garlic clove, grated/crushed
- Zest of ½ lemon
- Juice of ½ lemon
- 2 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- 5L water with 200g sea salt

Boil 5L water with 200g sea salt mixed in.

Blanch beans until they are starting to soften, but are still firm (about 6-8 mins). If using different kinds of beans blanch them separately so they're all cooked to the same degree.

Immediately remove from water and plunge into ice cold water to stop the cooking (and keep a bright green colour).

When completely cold, remove and strain.

In a big mixing bowl combine the beans ,salt, garlic, lemon zest and juice, and olive oil. Mix well and serve.
