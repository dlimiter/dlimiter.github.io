serves: Makes a bowl of beans
ingredients:
- 500g green beans (any variety)

- ½ tsp sea salt

---

Boil 5L water with 200g sea salt mixed in.

Put beans into the boiling water, if you are using more than one kind, blanch them separately.

Blanch until beans start to soften (about 6-8 mins), remove from water into a big owl filled with ice cold water (this will stop the cooking and keep a bright green colour for the beans.)
When completely cold, remove from the cold water and set in a strainer for all the water to drain out.

Put the beans in a bowl big enough to mix. Add the sea salt, grated ½ clove fo garlic, zest of 1 lemon, juice of ½ a lemon, and 3 tbsp of olive oil.

Mix well and serve.
