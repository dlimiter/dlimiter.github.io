title: Pikelets
description: Nabbed and adapted from a waiting room cookbook.
author: Dame Alison Holst
serves: About 12 pikelets
ingredients:
- 1 cup self raising flour
- 1 large egg
- Â½ cup milk
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 25g butter
- 1 tablespoon (rounded) golden syrup
---

Measure golden syrup into bowl with hot tablespoon. Add butter and warm slightly in microwave to soften. Mix in sugar, milk and egg.

Sprinkle or sift flour over top and mix briefly with a whisk or beater until just smooth.

Rub surface of hot frying pan with butter and paper towel. Drop tablespoons of mixture into pan, pouring mixture off the tip of the spoon. If mixture is too thick add more milk.

Turn pikelets as soon as bubbles begin to burst on the surface (and adjust heat depending on level of brownness). Cook the second side until the center springs back when touched with finger.

Cook in batches until all batter is used. Keep cooked pikelets warm in clean tea towel.

Depends on the butter, but I think a pinch of salt wouldn't hurt.
