title: My home sourdough
description: My everyday white-ish sourdough. Adapted from the Aran cookbook with a slightly higher hydration and longer bulk ferment (and no mucking about with autolyse). Can make and bake in a day or prove in the fridge for a more convenient bake time.
author: Dave Lim
serves: Makes 1 small loaf
ingredients:
- 325 grams bread flour
- 2 tsp salt (10g)
- 75 grams active sourdough starter
- 230g water

#### Feed starter
When to feed depends on a lot of variables like the liveliness of the starter and the ambient temperature, but you want to time it so that the starter is at its peak (at least double in size, rounded top, passes the float test) when you start the autolyse.  

#### Mix & fold
Mix everything. Stretch and work the dough as you mix until it develops some structure. Can use slap folds or Rubaud or whatever methods works with the least amount of mess and fuss.

Cover the bowl and place in a warm place for two to three hours, with a cycle or stretch and fold every half hour.

#### Bulk ferment
Leave for about two hours in a warm place until roughly doubled in size.

#### Shape & bench rest
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured bench. Without being too rough fold the dough into a rough ball and bench rest for 30 minutes. If the gluten formation has gone well it should hold a fair bit of its shape.

Shape the dough in your preferred way, trying to maintain surface tension. Leave for a couple of minutes to help he seam seal, then transfer to a well floured (use some rice flour if having trouble with sticking) banneton (or proofing basket or tea towel covered bowl or whatever), seam side up. If the seam isn't well sealed, you can pinch seal to close it up.

#### Final proof
If you're going to bake the next day, give it about a half hour to settle and start rising in a warm place, then transfer to the fridge to prove overnight.

Alternatively, if you plan to bake the same day, leave out in a warm place for about two hours until it passes the poke test.

#### Bake
Preheat a cast iron pot or dutch oven on the oven's highest setting (around 260°C) for at least 30 minutes. When you're ready, turn the loaf out onto some floured baking paper and score. Transfer straight to the pot and bake for 25 to 30 minutes covered, then take the top off the pot and allow it to continue to cook until it is brown and crusty all over, usually another 20 minutes or so.

When it looks done you can temper the loaf for an extra crispy crust by leaving it in the turned off oven for 10 or 20 minutes with the door ajar so the heat can escape. Then leave the loaf on a rack to cool for at least an hour (ideally longer – until the interior is back to room temperature).
