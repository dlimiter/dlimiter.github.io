#### Feed starter
When to feed depends on a lot of variables like the liveliness of the starter and the ambient temperature, but you want to time it so that the starter is at its peak (at least double in size, rounded top, passes the float test) when you start the autolyse.  

#### Autolyse
Dissolve the starter in about 200g of the water. Mix well with the flour, and put in a covered bowl in a warm place for 45 minutes to an hour.

#### Mix & fold
Dissolve the salt in the remaining water, and mix into the autolysed dough. This gets pretty messy so once it's starting to come together I usually slap-folds until the dough starts to bind to itself and develop a bit of structure.

Cover the bowl and place in a warm place for two to three hours, with a stretch and fold every half hour.

#### Bulk ferment
Leave for about two and a half hours in a warm place until roughly doubled in size.

#### Shape & bench rest
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured bench. Without being too rough fold the dough into a rough ball and bench rest for 30 minutes. If the gluten formation has gone well it should hold a fair bit of its shape.

Shape the dough in your preferred way, trying to maintain surface tension. Leave for a couple of minutes to help he seam seal, then transfer to a well floured (use some rice flour if having trouble with sticking) banneton (or proofing basket or tea towel covered bowl or whatever), seam side up. If the seam isn't well sealed, you can pinch seal to close it up.

#### Final proof
Give it about a half hour to settle and start rising in a warm place, then transfer to the fridge to prove overnight.

#### Bake
Next day, preheat a cast iron pot or dutch oven on the oven's highest setting (around 260°C) for at least 30 minutes. When you're ready, get the loaf out of the fridge. Turn it out onto some floured baking paper and score. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes covered, then take the top off the pot and allow it to continue to cook until it is brown and crusty all over, usually another 20 minutes or so.

When it looks done you can temper the loaf for an extra crispy crust by turning off the oven and leaving the door ajar so the heat can escape. Then leave the loaf on a rack to cool for at least an hour (ideally until the interior is back to room temperature).
