    You'll learn the ins and outs of designing and crafting rings, then take your two creations home. Our 2 hour workshop is beginner friendly.
    Our professional jewellers guide you through every step of the way.
    Your rings are customisable, including adding letters and numbers.
    <a href="https://blondestore.com.au/products/melbourne-ring-making-classes-1">The classes</a> are now held in our brand new flagship studio 344 Brunswick St, Fitzroy
  </p>
  <p>
    Please ensure you arrive a little early to your class start time.
    It will mean we can bring everyone in and kick off on time - preventing the rest of the class from being held up,
    and also ensuring everyone has enough time to finish both rings comfortably!
  </p>
  <p>

    We've got all the tools, metals and materials with us so there's no need to bring anything but yourselves along!
    Any issues on the day please call the studio mobile 0466 937 317.
